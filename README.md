## Overview

**Project Overview:**

This project involves the creation of a responsive social link profile card designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, with the flexibility to adapt to different screen sizes.

The webpage displays essential personal details, including the individual's name, address, and a brief "About Me" section, along with links to various social profiles. Visitors can easily access these links to learn more about the person.

Each social profile link features a dynamic hover effect, changing colors when hovered over, adding an interactive touch to the user experience.

The webpage is built with responsive design principles, ensuring an optimized and seamless experience across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones, allowing users to access and engage with the content effortlessly.

> This is a solution to the [Social Links Profile Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ/). Frontend Mentor challenges helps improving coding skills by building realistic projects.
